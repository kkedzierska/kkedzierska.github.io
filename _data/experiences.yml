  company: Ratan group, Center for Public Health Genomics @ UVa
  details: "I'm working with somatic mutations in various cancers and SNPs in different 
  populations from 1000 Genomes Project. I'm also wrapping up the analysis of the data 
  generated in Pemberton/Wotton lab (Epigenomic regulation in prostate cancer)."

  role: Visiting Graduate Student
  time: July 2016 - June 2017
  company: Pemberton lab, Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology Departament @ UVa
  details: "I joined the project 'Epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer' in which 
  I was responsible for both, sample processing and preparation for sequening and analyzing 
  data generated by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments. I gained more experience in 
  sample processing techniques which I find very useful in analysing the data coming from 
  high throughput sequencing."

  role: Research Assistant
  time: July 2015 - June 2016
  company: Laboratory of Zebrafish Developmental Genomics @ IIMCB in Warsaw
  details: "I joined the efforts of elucidating the gene regulatory network of zebrafish heart 
  development using genomics. I was involved in both - gathering biological material, sample 
  procesing and performing wet lab experiments together with data analysis. We applied RNA-seq
  and ATAC-seq techniques to understand the heart development in zebrafish embryos."
